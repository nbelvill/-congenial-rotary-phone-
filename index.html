    <h1>Nick Venuto&nbsp;</h1>
    <h3>Acre Mortgage </h3>
    <p><strong>BIO&nbsp;</strong></p>
<hr>
    <p>&nbsp; Backed by 18 plus years of mortgage lending experience, Nick started his own Branch with Acre Mortgage in 2011, after owning a Branch with Precision Funding Group for 3 years. Nick is currently licensed through the NMLS in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. Nick believes that education, honesty, and service are the strengths of his business that set him apart from others within the industry. These factors have played an integral role in building of a quality network of business partners and has contributed to his success in obtaining the best financing options for his clients. Nick's goal is to custom tailor every loan to match each clients individual needs. Through this process he educates each client on how their unique qualifications will affect the loan better or worse. He strives to ensure that his client's decisions are based upon complete information, not just the typical "rate and fee" quote. Nick maintains that each client and every business partner deserves a superior experience that includes reliable, hands on, personalized attention, delivered with a high degree of customer service. Nick has been a homeowner in Gloucester Twp. NJ since 2001. Nick and his wife Dana have two children Nicholas and Adriana.</p>
